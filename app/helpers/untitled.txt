Overall - 70/100 
- I dint like the new "extra" score that is added at the beginning. it does not come out well for me.
- The FONT colors, types, effects chosen are better
- Story telling is better
- more inspiring

0.00 - 0.05 Start is strong! Super font color used at the start! looks perfectly professional!
0.06 - 0.08 "Transform to progress" is a conclusive statement. It is the punch. Punch needs to be at the End.
0.13 - 0.35 -- the background score is making the shots "tense". Sort of "Anxious" score. I would prefer if its removed
0.36 - 0.40 - this is excellent. Dream Big is landing excellently. But the appearnace of Explore is somewhat taking its value.
